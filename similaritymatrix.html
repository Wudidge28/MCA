      <h2>Similarity Comparisons Using music21 </h2>
      <p>Using a selection of demo tracks provided and then by entering my own trancscriptions, the following page shows a similarity matrix
       and heat map comparing the genre of tracks, followed by a comparison of transcriptions from two different data types.</p>
       
	    <h3>Similarity Matrix</h3>
	    <p>These images are collated from the raw featres the tracks found in The Similarity Matrx folder which includes 3 of my tracks as raw csv. files and demo tracks./p>

	<h3>Similarity Comparison between Notated and Acoustic Musical Data</h2>
        <p>The two transcriptions below are from my <a href="https://wudidge28.github.io/MCA/lavandertown.html"><b>Lavender Town</b></a> track,
        one from MuseScore and the other which was trancribed from MuseScore into SonicVisualizer and back again.</p>

	<h4>Notated Vs. Acoustic Transcription Comparison</h4>
	<p>Comparing this to the two trancriptions of the composition above, it is apparent that:</p><br>
	
	<ul>
	    
           <li>The Sonic Visualizer transcription removes the ottava present in the original file; instead placing the notes higher on the staffs in order to replicate the higher pitch sound from the original.</li> 
           <li>While the original composition has no distinct Key signature, the Sonic Visualizer transcription has added G Major Key signatures to each measure of the track.</li>
           <li>The Sonic Visualizer transcription has added in multiple rest notes, which were not present in original composition.</li>
	   <li>The Sonic Visualizer transcription includes multiple connecting ties between notes.</li>
	   
	</ul>   

        <p>When played back however, these differences are negligible to the human ear as the composition remains acoustically the same.<br>
        Therefore, I can confidently say that the Sonic Visualiser transcribed the track with a <b>high degree of accuracy<b>; if sacrificing the notational structure.</p>
