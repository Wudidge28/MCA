# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

Music Analytics Dataset Theme: Video Game Music

My Chosen Dataset topic is Video Game Music. This is a broad dataset choice but in doing so it allows for me to look at tracks for different time periods and of different genre and notational complexity. This is more beneficial in testing my analysis and visualisations as opposed to a dataset composed of tracks from on artist or one milieu i.e. One Film or Videogame. 

Descriptive Data (Metadata): 

Genre: Video-Game, Chiptune, Ambient, Lounge, Downtempo

Year: 1995-2008

•	Pokemon Red/ Blue/ Yellow (1998, Game Freak)

-	Name: Wii Channel Theme
-	Composer: Kazumi Totaka
Notational Data:
Video Game sheet music is widely available on the world wide web through multiple user created and official databases. This may be in part due to the resignation of videogame music as Background Music (BGM) and short, repetitive looping tracks in titles as instrumental pieces in contrast to audio in other modals of popular culture which can be long scores or pop vocal songs. NInSheetMusic.org lists itself as the “largest free Nintendo Sheet Music resource on the web” as an example. 
Below are examples of notational resources for my chosen tracks in the dataset:
•	Lavender Town: https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/download/pdf/1532  
•	Victory Fanfare: https://ichigos.com/res/getfile.php?id=1487&type=pdf&token=fc64088b0f734c47f016d7a69cc53333  
•	Wii Channel: https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/download/pdf/1012 

Acoustic Data:
Video Game Music is readily available on Youtube; links to acoustic renditions made by fans of each track are below:
•	Lavender Town - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBF_m71vSrY 
•	Victory Fanfare https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPBRbIvs5lc 
•	Wii Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auj9J2bKbvY 

Current Datasets:
As touched upon earlier, websites such as NintenSheet offer a large corpora of music notational and downloads, and others offer vast collections of MIDI downloads such as VGMusic.com. However, I was only able to identify a Kaggle User under the ‘moriano’ as using specific analysis techniques in a VGM dataset; found here: https://www.kaggle.com/moriano/video-games-dataset-exploration. The user utilises python and histogram to analyse his dataset which is considerably larger than the pan for my theme. Therefore, this makes this dataset set an explorative research process.
